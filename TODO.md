## Theory: Rezende and & Mohamed
- [x] equations 1, 2, 3 (+) (marginal likelihood, objective) S
- [x] reparameterization trick
- [x] equations 5-8
- [x] flows in 4.1
- [x] Algorithm 1 (optimization) S

## Putting theory to practice
- [x] decide on a couple of interesting test problems/applications
- [x] implementing a crude version of Algorithm 1 such that the underlying model and the variational family can easily be changed later
- [x] recreate experiment top row in figure 3 in Rezende & Mohamed paper
- [] start looking into more advanced flows, e.g. non-volume preserving flows (https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.08803), Bernstein flows (https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.03509), or something similar

3) Systematic experiments
